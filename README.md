Introduction 
My final year project title for web API is Blogging for you which is an online photo blogging website where user can create their account and can login though it with the help of email and password. Here I have developed an website which is called Blogging for you that give its user a platform where they can post their day to day event, situation, topic in a blog an post it and get the feedback as a comment from other users. These website is all about posting the blogs by the user which can be seen by other user and can give their comment on the blogs. Here user only need to select a photo which they want to post with the status and category. This website will help the user to post their thought among the other users and get there feedback as comment.
It mainly focused to the people who can’t express their opinions, views regarding any topic in a real life but with help of these application they can express their thoughts, opinions without worrying any things. People will be able to rise the problem regarding any topic by posting a blog though which other people can give their views, opinions.
